### Little bit on me
I am Tien-Hong, a research engineer in Speech & Spoken Language Processing. I have broad interest in [Speech Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) and [Computer-assisted pronunciation training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_language_learning). 

Currently I am working as a 2nd-year PhD student, jointly funded by [School of Computing @ Uni. of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/cs) and [MULTISPEECH @ Inria Nancy Grand Est](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/). Previously after getting MSc from Edinburgh, I stayed there working as an R&D engineer at [Emotech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotech-ltd/).

I am curious about everything in terms of speech and language and I am aware that I need to code everyday to keep myself fresh. I am an active user and lover of [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) and have bits of contribution to it - Check its scripts on [Aishell2](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/aishell2) and [HI-MIA](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/hi_mia/v1) for more.

More detailed ver. of CV is available on request. Cheers!
